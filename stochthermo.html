						Since the seminal work of Claude Shannon and his Shannon entropy, there has been progress relating information theory to thermodynamics. The Shannon entropy, and its relationship to the thermodynamic entropy, is at the core of this. Given the deep connections between information theory and thermodynamics, an important question can be asked: do there exist decompositions of thermodynamic observables into information-theoretic quantities? My work provides an answer this question by demonstrating information-theoretic decompositions of thermodynamic observables that track the reversible exchange of entropy between a system and its environment, the irreversible internal production of entropy within a system, and the total change of entropy from these two contributions. My resulting decomposition is entirely in terms of information-theoretic quantities known as finite-time entropy rates. This connection between information theory and thermodynamics holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium and even in the presence of external forces.

						Since my work focuses on the irreversible production of entropy, it is naturally related to the second law of thermodynamics. I have shown that this irreversible component of the entropy can be seen as a (pre)-measure of time-reversal asymmetry even in the case of discrete-time. I have also illustrated how this decomposition sheds light on ensemble averages versus experimental realizations by building on previous work regarding the typicality of particular paths (i.e. a cup of hot coffee in a room will almost always cool down, but, by the second law, will virtually never heat up).
